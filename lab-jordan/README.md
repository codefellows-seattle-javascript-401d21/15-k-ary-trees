# Turning HTML Files Into Trees

### Installation and use

when the project is in your working directory, use `npm i` to install any dependencies it needs. Once ready, you can convert an html file in the assets folder into a JavaScript tree.

### Methods

Use the `.create(file)` method to create a tree out of the html file you pass in. This file name must contain the `.html` extention, and be found within the assets folder of the program's directory.
